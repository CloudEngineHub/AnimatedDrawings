## Animated Drawings

This repo contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper, `A Method for Automatically Animating Children's Drawings of the Human Figure' (currenly under peer review). 

In addition, this repo aims to be a useful creative tool in its own right, allowing you to flexibly create animations starring your own drawn characters.

If you do create something fun with this, let us know! Use hashtag [**#FAIRAnimatedDrawings**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FAIRAnimatedDrawings)

## Using Animated Drawings

Once you've installed AnimatedDrawings, using it is as simple as importing the package and specifying a configuration file.
Here's an example:

```python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/interactive_window_example.yaml')
```
And the resulting window:

</Gallery>

## Options

By modifying the configuration files, you can switch characters, apply different motions, change output formats, and more!
Here are a couple examples:

### Adding a background image
Suppose you'd like to add a background to the animation. You can do so by specifying the image path within the config.
Run the following commands from a Python interpreter within the AnimatedDrawings root directory:

```python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/background_example.yaml')
```

<Gallery columns={2} color="red-50" spaceTop spaceBottom>
  <Image url="/assets/images/char4_original_image.png" />
  <Image url="/assets/images/background_example.gif" />
</Gallery>

### Animate Your Own Drawing
We also provide scripts and models so you can animate your own drawings with a single command:
```bash
python image_to_animation.py drawings/garlic.png garlic_out
```
</Content>

<Gallery columns={2} color="red-50" spaceTop spaceBottom>
  <Image url="/assets/images/garlic.png" />
